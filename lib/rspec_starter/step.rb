# RspecStarterStep is essentially an abstract super class. It should not be instantiated directly. It primarily holds the
# logic for executing a Task or Command. Steps (and their subclasses) maintain three different types of options.
#   1. Command Options - These are specified on the command line when the bin/start_rspec command is run.
#   2. Step Options - These are specified inside the bin/start_rspec file when a task or command is added to the step list.
#   3. Step Defaults - Steps define default values when Command Options or Step Options are not given.

  # an error that terminates the entire process. This method is focused on running a step, getting results and displaying output.

  # that terminates everything.
